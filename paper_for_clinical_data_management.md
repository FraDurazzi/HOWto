## Tidy data

### abstract
A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, 
but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible.
This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying.
Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure:
each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.
This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to 
deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets.
This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets.
The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from 
mundane data manipulation chores.

## Data organization in spreadsheets

### abstract
Spreadsheets are widely used software tools for data entry, storage, analysis, and
visualization. Focusing on the data entry and storage aspects, this paper offers prac-
tical recommendations for organizing spreadsheet data to reduce errors and ease later
analyses. The basic principles are: be consistent, write dates like YYYY-MM-DD,
don’t leave any cells empty, put just one thing in a cell, organize the data as a single
rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header
row), create a data dictionary, don’t include calculations in the raw data files, don’t
use font color or highlighting as data, choose good names for things, make backups,
use data validation to avoid data entry errors, and save the data in plain text file.


## Three things that every medical writer should know about statistics
* Stephen Senn
* The WriteStuff
* Vol. 18, No. 3, 2009

### abstract
The joke goes that there are three kind of statistician: those
who can count and those who can’t. Therefore, readers of
the Write Stuff will forgive me, I hope, if I end up writing about more than three things.
It should be obvious, in
that case, as to which sort of statistician I am. There are,
of course, many more things than three that every medical writer 
should know about statistics because there are
many things about statistics that anybody working in drug
development should know and medical writers are in the
unenviable position of having to know about everything.
However, everybody has to start somewhere and three is a
number with a great tradition. The three things I am going
to write about are regression to the mean [1], the error of
the transposed conditional [2] and individual response [3].
The first is a widespread phenomenon that has a powerful
influence on the way that results appear to us, the second
is a pernicious fallacy and the third is a sort of Holy Grail-
cum-wild goose chase that is responsible for leading many
a researcher astray.
